# STA108Project

The dataset that we will be analyzing in our project is demographic information on 440 selected counties in the United States. In the dataset, each county is coordinated with an identification number that represents a county. We will analyze the regression functions and how their slopes, intercepts, and MSE vary. Analysis of certain variables will be narrowed down within each region (NE, NC, S, and W) and we will compare the regression functions and MSE between them.
